# State_Estimation
Temperature-control-Lab-using-Kalman-filter:
-Modelling of TC Lab (two temperature sensors and heaters mounted on Aurdino) in Matlab and Simulink.
-Implementation of Kalman filter and Extended Kalman filter to estimate state using sensor fusion. 
-Designed an integral Full State feedback controller to maintain the temperature at the desired set point.
